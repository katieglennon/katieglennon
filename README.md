## Hi there 👋 I'm Katie

I'm a **Full-Stack Software Engineer** with professional experience building applications using **TypeScript, Node.js, Vue.js, Nuxt, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB**. My expertise extends to **React**, **Python**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **MySQL**, and **Knex**.

Recently, I worked as a **Junior Full-Stack Engineer at Relevance AI in Sydney**, where I developed new features and improved applications across the front end and back end.  

💡 With 5+ years of prior experience as a **Product Manager in renewable energy tech**, I bring a unique ability to bridge product strategy with technical execution.  

🌱 Passionate about sustainability and impact-driven software, I enjoy building tools that blend innovation with purpose.

🍲 Featured Project: **Fridge Bingo** – a full-stack web app that reduces food waste by suggesting recipes from user-inputted ingredients (React, Node.js, Express, Knex).

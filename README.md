## Hi there 👋 I'm Katie

I'm a **Full-Stack Software Engineer** with expertise in **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **MySQL**, and **Knex**. Lately, I've been diving into **Python** to expand my technical toolkit.

💡 Before transitioning into software engineering, I spent over five years as a **Product Manager** in the renewable energy tech space. This background gives me a unique perspective: I deeply understand the entire product lifecycle—from strategic vision to technical execution—and excel at delivering user-focused, impactful solutions.

🌱 My mission is to create technology that drives sustainability and makes a difference in the world. With a blend of technical skills and product expertise, I'm passionate about building tools that blend innovation with purpose.

🍲 Fridge Bingo is a full-stack web app I developed using React, Node.js, Express, and Knex. This AI-driven tool suggests recipes based on user-inputted ingredients, aiming to make cooking accessible, reduce food waste, and inspire creativity in the kitchen.
